### Crop Recommendation System Using Django and Machine Learning

### Team:
### Team members - Juma Shija

### Roles:
The team members worked on the Django framework, where the main roles included developing the backend and front end, training the dataset using machine learning, and deploying the machine learning model in the system developed using the Django framework.
These roles are to completely develop the crop recommender system using machine learning techniques and the Django framework.

### Technologies:
Technologies included in this project are machine learning and web development using Python 3.8+.
Libraries for machine learning are Scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Theano, and Seaborn.
The Django library that can be used for this project is the Django REST Framework, which optimises and simplifies the process of creating RESTful APIs.
Languages for the Django framework include Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Python 3.8+. Also, the language for machine learning is Python 3.8+.
A platform for machine learning is TensorFlow, and Django is for web systems. The framework for developing the system is Django. 
The hardware required includes a fifth-generation CPU, GPU, and memory with no less than 512 GB, 10 GbE, or 40 GbE ports. Also, a machine learning system requires storage devices; most hardware used in developing a machine learning system uses NVMe drives instead of SATA SSDs.



### The books that can be used in this project are:  
Django for APIs: Build Web APIs with Python & Django by William S. Vincent, Django for Beginners 2.1 by William S. Vincent, and Django ResTFul Web Services by Gaston C. Hillar.
Other resources include the Internet and discussions with friends familiar with machine learning and the Django framework.
Alternative technologies for system development include C++, Flask, Laravel, and Ruby, but Django is a robust, comprehensive, and more standardised and simplified framework. Python 3.8+ is a more easy language than C++, and most literature on machine learning is written using Python and not C++ or other languages.

### Challenges:
In Tanzania, most farmers cultivate crops without knowing the types of crops to grow during a certain period, or the amount of rainfall, temperature, humidity, fertilisers, and pH scale of the soil. As a result, they failed to harvest the number of crops they expected due to the wrong use of the parameters mentioned above. They don’t know which crops to cultivate at which time of the year and what kind of fertilizer to use. 
This project can solve this problem by recommending to farmers the kinds of crops to cultivate when the temperature, rainfall, humidity, pH scale of the soil, and types of fertilisers are known. The farmers will use the parameters to predict the kind of crops they have to grow during a certain period, where all the parameters will be given by the Tanzania Meteorological Authority (TMA) and Agricultural Officers.
The project will not solve the errors that the TMA can cause during weather forecasting.
The project will help farmers in Tanzania, East Africa and Africa at large. Also, this project is relevant to the local areas in Tanzania due to the availability of resources and day-to-day weather forecasting.
### Risks:
Risks which can occur during the project include device failure. But this can be solved by using online platforms like Google Colab. 
Also, some non-technical risks include the hardship of collecting data due to financial scarcity. Also, this can be mitigated by using secondary data which are available on the platforms like Kaggle.

### Infrastructure:
The system can be deployed using HEROKU, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. Also, users can fill in the forms and submit the data for the system to recommend the type of crops to be cultivated according to the parameters given by the users. 

### Existing Solutions:
There are many crop recommendation systems developed, but the difference between this system with most of them is the use of django technology and the use of many parameters during machine learning model training.
